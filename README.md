Purpose: This respository contains the analysis notebooks used for generating the figures and tables in the manuscript “Rare and Common Variants Associated with Alcohol Consumption Identify a Conserved Molecular Network.” Source data is from Genebass (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2022.100168), GSCAN (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05477-4), and the Neale lab (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kvPoupSzsSFBNSztMzl04xMoSC3Kcx3CrjVf4yBmESU/edit#gid=227859291). SNP2Gene was run using MAGMA. Due to size of files, only the MAGMA gene level input data are included in this repository. 

Briefly, this repository was used to generate a molecular gene network from rare and common variants associated with alcohol consumption, the alcohol consumption network (ACN). These notebooks were also used to validate this network.

Contents of this repository:
-   conda_environment.yml- contains the packages needed for running these functions. NOTE: These notebooks require NetColoc (https://github.com/ucsd-ccbb/NetColoc), which in turn requires DDOT and cdapsutil. 
        DDOT can be installed one of two ways:
            To install DDOT by downloading the zip file of the source tree:
            wget https://github.com/idekerlab/ddot/archive/refs/heads/python3.zip
            unzip python3.zip
            cd ddot-python3
            python setup.py bdist_wheel
            pip install dist/ddot*py3*whl
            
            To install DDOT by cloning the repo:
            git clone --branch python3 https://github.com/idekerlab/ddot.git
            cd ddot
            python setup.py bdist_wheel
            pip install dist/ddot*py3*whl
            Note

            Due to dependency issue DDOT, will not work with Python 3.10 or later

            Additional requirements for full functionality of example notebook: cdapsutil >= 0.2.0a1 which can be installed using pip install cdapsutil
